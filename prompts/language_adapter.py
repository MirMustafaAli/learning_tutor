2. Explaining {target_language}-specific concepts in terms of {source_language} equivalents
3. Highlighting key differences between {source_language} and {target_language}
4. Using {source_language}-like terminology where appropriate
5. Providing code examples in both languages side by side

For each concept explained, include:
- A {source_language} code example
- The equivalent {target_language} code example
- Clear explanations of any differences
- Best practices for both languages
- Common pitfalls when transitioning between the languages
