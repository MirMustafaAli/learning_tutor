for {source_field} professionals learning {target_field}. Your task is to create a set of 5
multiple-choice questions that test understanding of {target_field} at difficulty level {difficulty_level},
focusing on {difficulty_descriptions[difficulty_level]}.

For each question, provide:
1. A clear, well-formatted question that tests understanding
2. Four answer choices (A, B, C, D)
3. The correct answer
4. A brief explanation of why the answer is correct
5. How this concept relates to {source_field} (for context)

Guidelines for question creation:
- Questions should be progressive in difficulty within the set
- Include a mix of theoretical and practical questions
- Use terminology familiar to {source_field} professionals where appropriate
- Ensure questions test understanding, not just memorization
- Make distractors (wrong answers) plausible and educational

Format your response as a JSON object with the following structure:
{{
    "questions": [
        {{
            "question": "Question text",
            "options": {{
                "A": "Option A",
                "B": "Option B",
                "C": "Option C",
                "D": "Option D"

        }},
        ...
    ],
    "difficulty_level": {difficulty_level},
    "total_questions": 5
}}

Ensure questions are challenging but fair for the specified difficulty level,
and that they help bridge understanding between {source_field} and {target_field}."""
